### Overview
##### **The key to the journey to Mars: the ion engine**


Exploring the vast wonders of space has always fascinated me, igniting a deep curiosity about the technologies that enable us to traverse the cosmic distances between celestial bodies. In the realm of propulsion systems, one innovation that particularly captivates me is the advent of ion engines. These electrostatically propelled marvels represent a paradigm shift from traditional chemical rockets, offering unparalleled efficiency and the potential for extended space missions. Having delved into this captivating field, I recently had the opportunity

to contribute to a project centered around the application of ion engines for deep-space exploration. Drawing inspiration from the success of missions like NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which harnessed the power of ion propulsion to explore asteroids Vesta and Ceres, our project aimed to further unlock the capabilities of these engines for ambitious missions into the far reaches of our solar system.

As we delved into the intricacies of ion propulsion, a significant aspect that emerged was the critical role of propellant selection. The choice of ionic gases, with xenon being a prevalent but scarce option, introduced a fascinating challenge. This led our team to explore innovative solutions for sustainable and efficient propellants, acknowledging the need for a strategic approach to ensure the continued advancement of ion engines.

Ion engines prove to be the superior option for long space journeys that require substantial fuel reserves. Unlike traditional chemical propulsion systems, ion engines offer exceptional efficiency, making them ideal for missions requiring continuous, low-thrust propulsion. Their ability to gradually increase a spacecraft's velocity over an extended duration makes them a preferred choice for interplanetary exploration and beyond. Additionally, these engines emerge as the superior solution for space study missions, such as transporting space telescopes, as well as for conveying consumables and spare parts to distant destinations. Their high efficiency and capability to maintain a steady thrust position them as essential tools for the execution of complex missions demanding increased endurance and optimal utilization of available resources.

In the recent hackathon, my team and I undertook an ambitious project aimed at developing a do-it-yourself (DIY) simulation of an ion engine, utilizing readily available materials. We were fortunate to have access to a vacuum chamber, which allowed us to conduct a series of comprehensive tests using various gases, including Xe, Ar, I2, He, and others. Our approach was rooted in a meticulous consideration of crucial properties such as molecular mass and ionization energy, which directly influence the propulsion force achievable with each gas. By experimenting with different gases, we sought to understand their impact on the density of propellants and, consequently, gauge the potential fuel efficiency achievable for space missions.

What set our project apart was the holistic evaluation of factors beyond mere performance metrics. We delved into considerations of cost-effectiveness, safety, and health factors associated with each gas. This comprehensive analysis aimed to identify propellants that not only optimized propulsion but also met the stringent criteria necessary for space travel. Through this hackathon endeavor, we not only simulated ion engine dynamics but also embarked on a journey to strategically assess and select the most suitable propellants for future space missions, keeping in mind the multifaceted challenges and demands of deep space exploration.
