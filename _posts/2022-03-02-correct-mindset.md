So it's another day, maybe a Monday or, God forbid, the beginning of a new month. And, **oh my**, it's time to make those new resolutions that I always abandon at the first sign of inconvenience.
ence.

    xkcd: Resolution</a>

I feel the problem here is faulty mental conditioning. Expecting someone to "go there and **do it**" is unrealistic. 
"Doing it" needs a number of factors to work smoothly. Things that are sometimes beyond my control. For example, I may try to start writing a blog *this* Monday but be unable to do so due to an important job at work that I had to do after office hours. That is how life is. It's difficult. 


So, instead, I think in a different way: Accept that I will *inevitably* encounter huge challenges in the future. 
For example, before committing to a new resolve, I like to squeeze skin on my arm to experience some discomfort. 
That way, I convince the lazy portion of my brain, "Yes, it will hurt." Yes, I will continue to feel agony. Yes, I will keep this resolution no matter what." More significantly, I picture how, despite my best efforts, I *fail* to attain whatever goal I had in mind. This, I feel, is particularly significant, since with long-term resolves, there will *inevitably* be times when I will be convinced that "it's hopeless, I can't do it.". "I failed." However, in long-term commitments, these brief moments of desperation should not decide the direction of action. It takes more time to ensure that I did, in fact, fail. And acting on such an inclination is just not healthy. 

Some may argue that this approach is synonymous with "having low expectations to be happier in the end." Having high expectations, on the other hand, inspires me more, despite what I wrote above. 


So, if I were to condense everything above in a single line, it would be something like "Pain *and* Gain." In addition, there is a film with the same name and concept [that exact name](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1980209/), check it out, it's great. :smile:
