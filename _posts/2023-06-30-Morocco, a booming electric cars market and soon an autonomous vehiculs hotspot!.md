## Jun 23, 17:40 - The future of autonomous vehicules in Africa

### Overview
With the recent new Moroccan made electric vehicle, I'm very glad to see that my country is establishing itself as a prominent participant in the electric car industry. Morocco already has a yearly production capability of 40,000 electric vehicles. According to the Moroccan Minister of Trade and Industry, the goal is to raise this to 100,000 by 2025.

Morocco is now a vibrant player in the automobile sector. It possesses a lot of advantages that are favorable to success in this industry.

### Future is promising

For starters, its excellent geographic location allows it to conveniently service European markets.

Furthermore, this North African country has significant renewable energy potential. As a result, it can generate **low-cost power** for electric vehicles. Morocco has a significant edge in wind and solar power generation due to its outstanding sunlight and exposure to strong, consistent winds. This allows it to diversify its energy sources and lessen its reliance on fossil fuels.

Morocco's automobile industry employs around 230,000 people, with a **trained workforce**. This workforce consists of highly skilled technicians, engineers, and workers. They have acquired extensive training and manufacture high-quality automobiles. The country intends to train even more specialists. The goal is to increase its desire to become a major participant in the electric vehicle market. Automotive schools and firms give appropriate training in robotics, electronics, information technology, and quality management. By investing in coaching and training in this manner, Morocco increases its attractiveness to international investors while also assisting in the creation of skilled employment in the country.

Atlas E-Mobility will launch **the very first electric car manufactured in Africa**, with the ambition of competing with Tesla in the market.

The introduction of self-driving cars in Morocco has the potential to transform the transportation environment and provide significant benefits to the country. These cars can improve road safety by reducing human mistake, reducing traffic congestion, and optimizing fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the adoption of self-driving vehicles might increase accessibility and transportation, particularly in distant or disadvantaged regions, boosting economic growth and linking communities. Adoption of this cutting-edge technology has the potential to establish Morocco as a regional leader in smart mobility, attracting investment and encouraging long-term urban development.
