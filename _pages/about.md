  Hi, I'm Yassir! 🎓 I graduated from Ecole Centrale Casablanca (Centrale-Supelec Group).I enjoy solving hard engineering problems at the intersections of software, AI and robotics. I'm passionate about building impactful tech projects and consider myself a lifelong learner, always curious to expand my knowledge in and outside of tech. <br/>

   Some of my favorite topics include cyber security, psychology, and history. <br/>
    I regularly share educational content through articles 📝 about my latest experiments . When I'm not coding or working out , you can find me volunteering, watching anime, and learning about different topics 🌎. <br/>I enjoy reading books 📚 and listening to podcasts 🎧 to keep my mind engaged.
